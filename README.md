# Shellwalker Timeline

This sample React project demonstrates a simple ability timeline for the **踏风排轴器**
(Windwalker Monk). It includes a form to set character stats and buttons for
triggering abilities. When an ability button is clicked it is added to a small
visual timeline grouped into four tracks:

1. Boss技能(1)
2. Boss技能(2)
3. 踏风技能(1)
4. 踏风技能(2)

Run `npm run dev` to start the Vite dev server or `npm run build` to create a
production bundle. Note that building requires a working install of `esbuild`
for your platform.
